<h2 id="background-of-presentation-scheduling-problem">Background of Presentation Scheduling Problem</h2>

<p>Presentation Scheduling problem, which is analogous to the famous University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP), involves allocating a set of presentations and resources including speakers, supervisors and venues to different time slots while considering various constraints. Supervisors have different preferences including choosing to attend certain number of consecutive presentations, choosing number of days to complete all the presentations and deciding whether they want to change venue while attending consecutive presentations. The problem is defined according to the following groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presentations</li>
  <li>Slots (Time slots and Venues)</li>
  <li>Supervisors</li>
  <li>Preferences</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> presentations will be scheduled to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> slots in which each slot is a combination of a venue and a time slot. For example, the timetable below has a total of 10 slots for 2 venues:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Day</th>
      <th>Venue</th>
      <th>0900-1000</th>
      <th>1000-1100</th>
      <th>1100-1200</th>
      <th>1300-1400</th>
      <th>1400-1500</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Monday</td>
      <td>Room A</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Monday</td>
      <td>Room B</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Each presentation is presented by a speaker and supervised by three supervisors. There are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> supervisors available. There are two types of constraints: hard constraints and soft constraints. Hard constraints cannot be violated to prevent generating an infeasible schedule, whereas soft constraints might be violated, however, the number of violations must be minimized.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hard Constraints</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>HC01</em>: All presentations must be scheduled and each presentation can be scheduled only once</li>
      <li><em>HC02</em>: No supervisors can attend two or more presentations concurrently</li>
      <li><em>HC03</em>: Some venues are unavailable on specific time slots</li>
      <li><em>HC04</em>: Some supervisors are unavailable on specific time slots</li>
      <li><em>HC05</em>: All presentations must be scheduled to a slot without sharing of venues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Soft Constraints</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>SC01</em>: Number of consecutive presentations should not exceed supervisor’s preference</li>
      <li><em>SC02</em>: Number of days in which a supervisor needs to attend a presentation should not exceed supervisor’s preference</li>
      <li><em>SC03</em>: Some supervisors prefer not to change venue while attending consecutive presentations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="data-input">Data Input</h2>

<p>In this repository, there are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n = 118</code> presentations, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m = 300</code> slots and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k = 47</code> supervisors. There are 4 venues: Viva Room (VR), Meeting Room (MR), Interaction Room (IR) and BJIM Discussion Room (BJIM). Each day has 15 slots in which each slot lasts for 30 minutes. 300 slots are shceduled from Monday until Friday.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note that each slot is a combination of a venue and a timeslot.</em></strong></p>

<p>There are 6 input files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SupExaAssign.csv</code> specifies supervisors that are in charge of the presentations</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC03</code> specifies unavailable venues</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC04</code> specifies unavailable supervisors on specific slots</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SC01</code> specifies supervisors’ preferred number of consecutive presentations</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SC02</code> specifies supervisors’ preferred number of days to complete all the presentations</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SC03</code> specifies supervisors’ preferences of changing venue during consecutive presentations, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yes</code> indicates supervisors prefer to attend consecutive presentations without changing venue, whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no</code> indicates supervisors do not want to change venue while attending consecutive presentations</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="hybrid-genetic-algorithm-simulated-annealing-hgasa-algorithm">Hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Simulated Annealing (HGASA) Algorithm</h2>

<p>Hybrid genetic algorithm-simulated annealing (HGASA) algorithm is the combination of genetic algorithm (GA) with simulated annealing as a local search method to accelerate the convergence speed. The figure below shows the flowchart of HGASA algorithm.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="./pics/HGASA_Flowchart.png" /></p>
<p align="center"><i>Flowchart of HGASA algorithm</i></p>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hybrid_system</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hybrid_system.py</code> for more details.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="encoding">Encoding</h3>

<p>The initial set of candidate solutions and sets of constraints are represented using matrix. The matrices are generated using given data from input files and through the process of matrix multiplication. The figure below shows three required matrices that are generated through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">load()</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data.py</code>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="./pics/matrices.png" /></p>
<p align="center"><i>From left, slot-by-presentation matrix, presentation-by-presentation matrix and supervisor-by-preference matrix</i></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slot-by-presentation</code> matrix is the chromosome in genetic algorithm and the candidate in simulated annealing. Other matrices are required by the penalty function for evaluation of penalty points. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> indicates the slots are available, whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code> indicates the slots are unavailable due to the hard constraints. When initializing the population, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> indicates a presentation has been assigned to a specific slot.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="penalty-function">Penalty Function</h3>

<p>The penalty function is used to evaluate the fitness of the solution, which is the resulting presentation schedule. It is used to evaluate any violations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC02</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SC01</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SC02</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SC03</code>. Each violation increases the penalty points by 10. The higher the penalty points, the lower the fitness of the solution.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note that if the number of consecutive presentations is less than the supervisor’s preference, each difference will increase the penalty point by 1 in order to encourage the generated schedule to have consecutive presentations.</em></strong></p>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">penalty_function.py</code> for more details.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="steady-state-genetic-algorithm-ga">Steady-State Genetic Algorithm (GA)</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~neal.holts/dga/optimizationAlgorithms/steadyStateGA.html">Steady-state genetic algorithm</a> is different from the generational genetic algorithm in which only two chromosomes are selected to undergo crossover and mutation to generate two children. Two worst chromosomes will be chosen from the population to be replaced by the new children. It updates the population in a piecemeal fashion rather than all at one time.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="initialize-population">Initialize Population</h4>

<p>The size of population is initialized to 10 which is an adequate size considering the size of this presentation scheduling problem. A random slot is assigned to each presentation in a chromosome. Note that the slots are assigned in a way such that the schedule does not violate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC03</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC04</code>. Empty slot indicates no presentation is assigned to this slot previously so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC01</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC05</code> will not be violated. Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>s in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slot-by-presentation</code> matrix (chromosome) represents the assigned presentation in its respective slot. Penalty of chromosome is evaluated and added to the population of penalty points.</p>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generate_chromosome</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genetic_algorithm.py</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hybrid_system.py</code> for more details.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="selection">Selection</h4>

<p>Tournament selection with tournament size of 2 is carried out twice. In each tournament selection, two random chromosomes are selected and the chromosome with the lowest penalty point among them is selected.</p>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">selection</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genetic_algorithm.py</code> for more details.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="crossover-and-repair">Crossover and Repair</h4>

<p>Two-point crossover is carried out to reduce the probability of breaking up good pairs in the chromosome which is more frequent in one-point crossover and uniform crossover. The parent chromosomes selected in tournament selection exchange their presentations between the cutpoints to produce two new children. The figure below shows two parent chromosomes exchange their presentations between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c2</code> to generate two new child chromosomes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="./pics/crossover.png" /></p>
<p align="center"><i>Crossover of two parent chromosomes</i></p>

<p>Repair is carried out after crossover in which the presentation is assigned to another available and empty slot if there are more than 1 presentations assigned for the slot. The purpose of this operation is to ensure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC01</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HC05</code> are not violated.</p>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crossover</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repair</code> functions in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genetic_algorithm.py</code> for more details.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="mutation">Mutation</h4>

<p>Two random presentations have their slots exchanged. If both presentations have slots that are not exchangeable, indicating the slots are unavailable for either one of the presentation, another presentation and slot are selected randomly. The figure below shows the mutation process.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="./pics/mutation.png" /></p>
<p align="center"><i>Mutation of a chromosome</i></p>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutation</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genetic_algorithm.py</code> for more details.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="penalty-evaluation-and-replacement">Penalty Evaluation and Replacement</h4>

<p>Two chromosomes with the highest penalty points are replaced by two new child chromosomes generated through crossover and mutation. Their penalty points are updated as well.The maximum number of generations is set to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code> generations in this case. In each generation, 6 processes are executed iteratively: selection, crossover, repair, mutation, penalty evaluation and replacement until the maximum generation is reached.</p>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replacement</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reproduction</code> functions in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genetic_algorithm.py</code> for more details.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="simulated-annealing-sa">Simulated Annealing (SA)</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">Simulated annealing</a> (SA) is used in HGASA algorithm as a local search algorithm. SA is a metaheuristic inspired by statistical physics. SA has the ability to avoid being trapped in local minima and it is proven that SA is able to find the global optimum if given infinite time.</p>

<p>The initial candidate of SA is the chromosome with the lowest penalty point from the previous GA. The basic procedure of SA is to generate neighbouring solutions and evaluate them. If the neighbouring solution generated is better than the best solution, the best solution is updated. If otherwise, the neighbouring solution is accepted based on a probability density function. The best solution will only be updated when the neighbouring solution is better than the best solution. A poor neighbouring solution will be accepted by probability as the candidate to generate a new neighbouring solution, but not as the best solution. The figure below shows the process of SA.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="./pics/simulated_annealing.png" /></p>
<p align="center"><i>Process of Simulated Annealing</i></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="random-neighbourhood-structure">Random Neighbourhood Structure</h4>

<p>In each iteration, one neighbourhood structure will be randomly selected to be applied to the candidate solution to produce a neighbouring solution. A neighbouring solution is a solution that is slightly different from the candidate solution. There are in total four neighbourhood structures implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Neighbourhood Structure 1</strong><br />
Select a supervisor at random and swap the timeslots of two presentations supervised by the supervisor</li>
  <li><strong>Neighbourhood Structure 2</strong><br />
Select a presentation at random and change its assigned venue without changing the assigned day and time</li>
  <li><strong>Neighbourhood Structure 3</strong><br />
Select a presentation at random and move it to a randomly selected empty slot</li>
  <li><strong>Neighbourhood Structure 4</strong><br />
Select a presentation at random and move another presentation that has at least one same supervisor to the empty slot adjacent to the presentation chosen at random</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neighbourhood_structure1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neighbourhood_structure2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neighbourhood_structure3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neighbourhood_structure4</code> functions in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulated_annealing.py</code> for more details.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="arrow_down_small-step-by-step-procedure">:arrow_down_small: Step-by-Step Procedure</h4>

<p>SA is carried out for a number of iterations until stopping criterion has been met. The procedure is described by the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Set Initial Annealing Temperature</strong><br />
The initial temperature of simulated annealing is set to the difference between the lowest and highest penalty points of the population found using GA.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply Random Neighbourhood Structure</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Penalty and Acceptance Probability</strong><br />
The penalty of the newly generated neighbouring solution is computed and compared with the penalty of the candidate solution. The neighbouring solution is accepted if it is better than the candidate solution. In the case where there is no improvement, a random number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> that is uninformedly distributed between 0 and 1 is generated and the probability density function value, <i>e</i><sup>-<i>δ/T</i></sup> is calculated. If the probability density function value is higher than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code>, the neighbouring solution is accepted as the candidate solution to generate a new neighbouring solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Cooling Schedule</strong><br />
An exponential cooling scheme (ECS) is used. The temperature decrement rule implemented is <i>T</i><sub><i>k</i> + 1</sub> = <i>αT<sub>k</sub></i> where &amp;alpha is set to 0.9999, a value very close to 1. The temperature is decreased slowly and continuously.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Temperature</strong><br />
The final temperature is the stopping condition. The final temperature is set to 0.0001 of the initial temperature.</li>
</ol>

<p>Refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anneal</code> function in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simulated_annealing.py</code> for more details.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="implementation-in-python">Implementation in Python</h2>

<p>Four external packages are used to implement HGASA algorithm:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/index.html">NumPy</a><br />
NumPy provides a powerful n-dimensional array structure and numerical computing tools. It is ideal to create matrix, and has a significantly faster data access speed and more efficient memory usage than Python list.</li>
  <li><a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/5minguide.html">Numba</a><br />
Numba is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Python that can speed up the execution of code that uses NumPy arrays and functions, and loops frequently. Parts of user-defined functions in Python are preceded with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@njit(cache=True)</code> decorator. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@njit()</code> compiles the decorated function in nopython mode so the compiled code runs without the involvement of Python interpreter. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cache=True</code> indicates the result of function compilation will be saved into a file-based cache to save compilation time when invoking decorated functions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/index.html">Matplotlib</a><br />
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library to create interactive visualizations in Python. One of its API, pyplot is used to create interactive plots in a figure. The interactive plot shows the graph of penalty points improvement over the number of iterations in HGASA. The graph can be zoomed, panned, configured and saved as a figure.</li>
  <li><a href="http://zetcode.com/python/prettytable/">PrettyTable</a><br />
PrettyTable can be used to visualize tabular data in ASCII table format. It is used to draw the timetable for the presentation schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental Results</h2>

<p>The table below shows the experimental result of running HGASA algorithm using the given input files where there are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n = 118</code> presentations, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m = 300</code> slots and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k = 47</code> supervisors.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong><em>Note that all the parameters used in HGASA algorithm are purely empirical and should be adjusted for other problems.</em></strong></p>

<p>The generated presentation schedule is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csv</code> format as shown below:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P9, null, null, P48, P36, null, ...</code>
The fragmented schedule above indicates that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P9</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P48</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P36</code> are scheduled for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slot 1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slot 4</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slot 5</code> respectively. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> indicates no presentation is scheduled for a particular slot.</p>

<p>A graph of penalty points over number of iterations will be saved in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">png</code> format. An example of the graph is shown below. The graph illustrates the improvement of presentation scheduling as number of iterations increases.</p>
